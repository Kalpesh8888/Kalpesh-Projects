	Variables in Java
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
A variable is only a name given to a memory location.
 All the operations done on the variable affect that memory location.
In Java, all variables must be declared before use.
	
	Types of Variables in Java
1)	Local Variables -A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 
2)Instance /golbal Variables - instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside of any method, constructor, or block. 
3)Static Variables - Static variables are also known as class variables. 
These variables are declared similarly to instance variables. 
The difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside of any method, constructor, or block.
